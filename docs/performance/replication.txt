- Replication: distribute live database server across multiple machines

- Replication in Mongo
    a) Master-Slave
    b) Replica Set (recommended, automaic failover strategy)

- one master server (for writes)
  and many secondary servers (for reads)

- in case of failure, on of secondary elected to be primary server
  (when failed server comes be live again it will be secondary)

- to ensure data durability mongo uses WiredTiger (Storage Engine),
  which writes logs into a journal with checkpoints 
  (used to restore database to last valid state)

- how replication works:
    a) oplog (enable replication, sync with secondary servers)
    b) heartbeat (monitor health and trigger failover)
