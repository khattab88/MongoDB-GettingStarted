-Replication:
Mongo uses Replica sets to protect database from failure on single machine

-RC file:
special file .mongorc.js which runs before mongo shell started
(you would place any bootstraping scripts in this file,
 instead of running these scripts everytime you open the shell)
 (you can use command mongo --norc to disable rc file)
 
-BSON: (Binary-encoded serialization format)
 MongoDB uses BSON format for data storage and network transfer.
 
- Every document should have "_id" field.
- Max document size = 16 MB.

- you can use any data type for "_id" field (numeric, string, date, object,....)
  except for array datatype
  
- if you save a document without a document id field "_id",
  mongo will assign document id value to an ObjectId
  
- if you try to save two documents with the same id,
  the later second document saved will override the first one
  
- you can use document insert command to preserve unique id constarint
  (unique id for each document, no duplication)
  
- updates on mongo document are atomic,
  means that two concurrent updates are executed one after the other
